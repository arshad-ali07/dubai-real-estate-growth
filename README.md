🏙️ Dubai Real Estate Growth Analysis (2015–2025)
This project explores the trends and growth of Dubai's real estate market from 2015 to 2025 using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We analyze key indicators such as property prices, transaction volume, population growth, rental trends, and housing supply.

📊 Key Objectives
- Analyze the **trend in average property price per square foot (AED)**
- Visualize the **total real estate transaction value** over time
- Examine the **correlation between population growth and rental prices**
- Compare **housing supply vs population demand**
- Identify **real estate investment opportunities** based on data trends

- 🧾 Dataset Overview
